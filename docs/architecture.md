Architecture (planned)

- Data ingestion (adapters per source)
- Thinking engine (rule engine + weighting + signal combiner)
- Persistence (feedback log, pick history, caching)
- CLI simulator (terminal-first testing)
- Discord adapter (slash commands, ephemeral responses, rate-limits)

Start locally with the CLI and a small JSON fixture dataset to validate logic.
