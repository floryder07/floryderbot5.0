Thinking Engine — initial notes

The thinking engine will:
- Accept structured input (player, team, market, window)
- Load recent game logs and compute trend hits
- Apply configurable weights per signal
- Output ranked picks with confidence and explanations

Start by implementing a simple rule-based combiner and JSON fixtures for game logs.
